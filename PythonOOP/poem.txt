Whispers of Midnight

In the hush of the moonlit air,
Your breath like silk upon my skin,
A dance of shadows soft and fair,
Where the night's quiet dreams begin.

Fingers trace, like wind through trees,
A melody in every sigh.
We are tangled waves in endless seas,
Where time dissolves, where echoes lie.

Eyes speak secrets, deep and slow,
A language only hearts can hear.
In the space where moments grow,
Desire blooms, pure and clear.

And in that space between the stars,
Where only whispers dare to roam,
We find our refuge, near or far,
In each other, our endless home.
